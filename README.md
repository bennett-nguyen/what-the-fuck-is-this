# what-the-fuck-is-this
**A project will be added every 1 week**

As the description of this repository suggested, this repo contains all of the bad code that I have written when I started learning to code. Look through different program that I written in the `src` folder, each project will have a text file that you can read through and learn about *how I came up with the idea for the project*, *the bad part of the code*, etc.
# Backstory

Back then, I didn't have a computer so I have to learn and program on a single PHONE. It was a very tough for me to just write and debug the code because I did all of that on a very poorly designed app for learnning programming and writing code, I think the project that worth the honorable mention is the [mole calculator](src/mole%20calculator/) program since it took me 2 months to complete it while in reality it only took days. It's also a very poorly written program and I wouldn't recommend you to parse through and rewrite it either.

Anyway, after buying a computer, I started to improve my knowledge about programming more and more. I learnt more about Python, its features, how to write readable and proficient code. Ultimately, I have improved significantly and now I can write Python code that is clearer than the code I used to write on my phone, it's not completely perfect but that's still better than not to improve at all.
