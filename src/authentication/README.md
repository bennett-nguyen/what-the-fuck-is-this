# Authentication

A simple authentication Python program that uses a text file as a "database" (This is the description I gave to this program when I created it, and yes I used the terminology "database" to show you how cool I am B] )

Basically it allows you to resgister an account (need a username and a password) and log into it. Once you logged in, the program stops executing. User's credentials are stored within a text file (AKA "database")

ATTENTION:
The text file will not be created automatically like in the JSON version so you have to check if there's a text file available in the directory that the source file is currently in

# Authentication JSON

Similar to the previous version but cooler (Introduced bug fixes, new features. And most importantly, use a JSON file as a "database" (cool terminology again eh?) )

# How Did I Came Up With The Idea?

This is the time when I got my first computer, that puts an end on 10000 years of coding on a phone. Having to code on a computer is nicer and 10x times more efficent than on a phone, some projects only take me hours to finish instead of a whole day. During that time, I had a chance to try out Python features that can't be perform on a phone, specifically FileIO and the JSON module. From there, I kept thinking about what project I should work on with those two features and I chose to make this authentication application.

# What's Bad With The Code?

Code is mostly optimal but implicit, inconsistent usage of snake_case and camelCase, and comment is overused
