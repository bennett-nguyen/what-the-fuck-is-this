# Mole calculator (original)

The mole calculator is my first Python project and is also the most poorly written one, it violates every single rule in The Zen of Python and I think I don't have to explain it to you. Just, look at the code.

# Mole calculator (improved)

This is the "improved" version of the first mole calculator, basically I grouped all of the repeated code into different functions to remove redundant code, I also apply decorators and stuff like that to make the code less complicated. Sadly, however, it only causes more ambiguity. Oh yeah, did I also mention that I used Pascal Case instead of snake_case?

# How Did I Came Up With The Idea?

I liked learning chemistry back in the day I started learning to program, I want to apply the knowledge I acquired from my chemistry class so I decided to make a program for it. And... you know what happened.

# What's Bad With The Code?
literally anything.
